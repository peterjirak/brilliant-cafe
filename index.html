                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Peter Eldritch. I am a senior software engineer with more than 15 years experience. I am passionate about people. I create software - integrations, automations, analyses, reporting, frameworks, content delivery systems, platforms, APIs, database schema and applications, and technology stacks including websites and web applications. In the end all technology, whether an automation, an integration, an analysis/reporting tool on the backend, a framework, content delivery system, etc. -- technology serves people. So my goal is to help my employer serve our clients/customers and their clients/customers.</p>
                <p>I am a Full Stack engineer with both strong front-end and back-end skills. My front-end experience is with React.JS. I have used both Create React App and Vite.JS for automated integrated toolchain and dependency management. On the backend I am well versed in database modeling, SQL, and Python. I am well versed in developing for Cloud-based ecosystems in particular AWS. My AWS experience includes Aurora Db using the PostGreSQL engine. I am passionate about the use of AWS serverless technologies to deliver affordable services that infinitely scale. I have experience with API Gateway, S3, SMS, and several other AWS services.</p>
                <p>Personally I enjoy hiking - I live in the Pacific Northwest; making ice cream, I have been working on several flavors including a cherry caramel bourbon and a bananas foster; cooking; writing; and photography. I am married to another technology solutions developer, his name is Kelly. We've even worked together a few times. We are both very passionate about developing amazing technology solutions and it enriches my life to get to share that passion with him. In addition to sharing a passion for technology, an interest in photography, and a love of ice cream, we have been learning to make delicious non-alcoholic cocktails. Here is a link to a non-alcoholic cocktail the two of us created: <a href="https://bit.ly/425H4TX">Alcohol Free: The Shirley Chisholm</a></p>

                        <P>Periodically I engage in projects to practice my skills, build my skills, so what I know, and create small project demos for potential employers and clients. I was interested in a JavaScript project, so I Googled for a project to create Tetris. I found a "tutorial" from Educative for building Tetris with modern JavaScript.</P>

                        <P>I initially anticipated that in this tutorial they solve the problem step by step and allow one to type along if one wished, the equivalent of those computer programming magazines from the 1980s which had programs one could type into one's computer, analogous to old paint-by-number paint kits where one created a painting by painting in the numbered shapes inside an outlined picture. Those kinds of tutorials can be instructive but they don't allow one to demonstrate one's own abilities since from start to finish the problem is solved for you.</P>
